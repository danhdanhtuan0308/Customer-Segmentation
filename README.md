# Customer-Segmentation

## Overview 
This project focuses on building a customer segmentation model that groups customers based on their behaviors and characteristics. Customer segmentation is a vital tool for businesses to understand their customer base, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction through personalized services through unsupervised learning algorithm ( K-means ).
## Project Structure
1) `data/`: OnlineRetail.csv ( download it ) 
2) `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb`: Contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
## Getting Started 
1) Python 3.7 or higher
2) JupyterNotebook
3) Python package ( pandas,numpy,matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, squarify , sklearn)
## Installation
1) Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ShopeeSentimentAnalysis.git
   cd ShopeeSentimentAnalysis
2) pip install -r requirements.txt
3) jupyter notebook or google colab
## Usage 
1) Open Customer_Segmentation.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
2) Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and analyze customer segments.
3) Review the output visualizations and segment profiles to gain insights into customer behavior.
## Feature 
1) Data-processing :
    - Data cleaning and normalization.
    - Handling missing values and outliers.
    - Feature engineering to enhance the quality of the input data for clustering.
2) Customer Segmentation :
    - Implementation of clustering algorithms like K-Means to identify distinct customer groups.
    - Visual representation of clusters using scatter plots and dendrograms.
    - Profiling of customer segments to create actionable insights for targeted marketing.
3) Model Evaluation :
    - Use of the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and giving comments.
## Result 
The model successfully segmented customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographics. These segments can be leveraged for more effective marketing strategies, personalized customer service, and improved customer retention.
## Dataset 
The data used in this project is sourced from internal business records, containing various customer demographics and transaction details. The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure high-quality input for the clustering algorithms used in this analysis
